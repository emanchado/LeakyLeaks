LeakyLeaks is a very simple application that allows you to search for
leaked cables by tag, office and text. It uses the

Technology
----------

LeakyLeaks is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's a simple,
static HTML file with Javascript, there's no server involved (except
leakfeed.com to fetch the data). It uses the
[Angular](http://angularjs.org) Javascript toolkit to fetch and present
the information, Twitter's
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for the HTML and CSS
and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) for the Javascript
unit-tests.
